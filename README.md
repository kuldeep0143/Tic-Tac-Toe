# ðŸš€  "Tic-Tac-Toe Game using React" Project! ðŸŽ®

I am thrilled to share our latest project - a fun and interactive two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React! ðŸ¤©

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features:-

âœ… Two players can enjoy a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

âœ… Player 1 is represented by the color blue, while Player 2 is in fiery red.

âœ… Keep track of your victories with a dynamic score display at the top of the game board!

ðŸ§¡ We've had a blast designing and developing this project, and we hope you'll enjoy playing it as much as we did creating it. Whether you're a React enthusiast or just looking for some friendly competition, our Tic-Tac-Toe game is the perfect way to have some fun and improve your React skills simultaneously.
